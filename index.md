## 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

**Personal information you disclose to us**

> *In Short:* We collect personal information that you provide to us.

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.

**Personal Information Provided by You.** The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:

* **Email Addresses:** Used for account creation, login, password reset, and potentially email verification.
* **Passwords:** Used for account login. Handled securely by Firebase Authentication; we do not store your plain text password.
* **Budget Plan Data:** Information you provide when creating budget plans, including plan names, budget amounts (if set), tax rates, tip percentages, and details about items within plans (item name, price, quantity, taxable status, tip inclusion status). This data is stored in Cloud Firestore and linked to your user account.
* **Application Settings:** User-configurable settings such as default tax rate and budget alert thresholds (warning percentage, big item percentage). These are stored in Cloud Firestore and linked to your user account.

**Sensitive Information.** We do not process sensitive information.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

## 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

> *In Short:* We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.

We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:

* **To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.** We may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.
* **To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.** We may process your information to provide you with the requested service.
* **To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.** We may process your information to respond to your inquiries and solve any potential issues you might have with the requested service.
* **To send administrative information to you.** We may process your information to send you details about our products and services, changes to our terms and policies, and other similar information.
* **To request feedback.** We may process your information when necessary to request feedback and to contact you about your use of our Services.
* **To protect our Services.** We may process your information as part of our efforts to keep our Services safe and secure, including fraud monitoring and prevention.
* **To evaluate and improve our Services, products, marketing, and your experience.** We may process your information when we believe it is necessary to identify usage trends, determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, and to evaluate and improve our Services, products, marketing, and your experience.
* **To store and sync your data across devices.** We process your budget plans and settings information to save it securely with your account using Cloud Firestore, allowing you to access your data if you log in on a different device.

## 3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

> *In Short:* We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.

We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

* **Service Providers**
    * We use Google Firebase services for essential app functionality. Firebase acts as a data processor to provide services such as:
        * **Firebase Authentication:** To securely manage user login, registration, password resets, and account deletion.
        * **Cloud Firestore:** To securely store and sync your user-generated data (budget plans, items, settings) linked to your account.
    * We only share information necessary for these services to function. We do not sell or share your personal information with other third parties for marketing or other unrelated purposes.

* **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

## 4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

> *In Short:* We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

> *In Short:* We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. We rely on the security infrastructure provided by Google Firebase and utilize Firestore Security Rules designed to restrict data access to authenticated users for their own information.

## 6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

> *In Short:* We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at **maperez1@cpp.edu**.

## 7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

> *In Short:* You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.

**Withdrawing your consent:** If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#11-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice)" below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

**Account Information**

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:

* Contact us using the contact information provided.

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at **maperez1@cpp.edu**.

## 8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online Browse activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

## 9. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

> *In Short:* If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law. More information is provided below.
